PCB Layout Constraints Document

System Requirements: The function of the IRKeyboard PCB is to provide a USB connection to a personal computer, 
where the IR receiver can receive signal transmitted by the IR keyboard. This PCB does substitute for an IR keyboard,
but it will allow the IR keyboard to transmit data to the personal computer. The board is

Additional Requirements:
Reduced trace stubs, Differential Pair mismatch length of about 0.5 inch will produce a phase mialignment of less than 100 picoseconds, which should be
acceptable because of the low GPIO sampling rate on the GPIO pins. Impedance matching purposes you will need to reroute the differential pair, when they are routed
in parallel that will drop the impedance of each individual trace. Because the impedance depends on the spacing of the traces and their height above the ground plane.
