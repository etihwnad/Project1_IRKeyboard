Additional Requirements:
Reduced trace stubs, Differential Pair mismatch length of about 0.5 inch will produce a phase mialignment of less than 100 picoseconds, which should be
acceptable because of the low GPIO sampling rate on the GPIO pins. Impedance matching purposes you will need to reroute the differential pair, when they are routed
in parallel that will drop the impedance of each individual trace. Because the impedance depends on the spacing of the traces and their height above the ground plane.
