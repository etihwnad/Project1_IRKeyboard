# Project1_IRKeyboard
PCB Layout Constraints Document: IN PROGRESS

System Requirements: 
The function of the IRKeyboard PCB is to provide a USB connection to a personal computer, 
where the IR receiver can receive signal transmitted by the IR keyboard. This PCB does not substitute for an IR keyboard,
but it will allow the IR keyboard to transmit data to the personal computer. The board is able to provide a

Physical Constraints:


Layer Stackup:
A single layer PCB was used for this design, because a single layer PCB is able to be laser cut. A ground fill was added to the top layer of the board to ensure all
traces stay on a single side of the PCB to create a single layer PCB.

Design Rules:
The USB contains D- and D+ pins, which is a differential pair. With a differential pair trace lengths must match as close as possible. For this particular PCB, routed
trace length was kept below 0.5 inch. Keeping this length below 0.5 inch produces a phase misalignment of less than 100 picoseconds. This misalignment is acceptable 
due to the low GPIO sampling rate on the GPIO pins. The differential pair must also be routed parallel to each other to drop the overall impedance of each individual 
trace. Impedance in this case depends on the spacing of the traces and the differential pair's height above the ground plane. 

Note: A clean ERC and DRC are required before design can be manufactured.

Manufacturing Requirements:
A single sided PCB will be manufactured for this design using a laser cutter.
